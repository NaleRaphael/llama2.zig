# llama2.zig
It's Just a work to reimplement [llama2.c][1] in zig, also a toy project for me
to explore zig.

BTW, there is already a stable zig implementation [cgbur/llama2.zig][2], feel
free to check it out!

## Development
- To run tests, it currently requires installing `PyTorch` to load checkpoint
    for checking whether weights are correctly mapped.
