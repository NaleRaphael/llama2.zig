# llama2.zig
This's just a work to reimplement [llama2.c][1] in Zig, also a toy project for
me to explore Zig.

If you are looking for a stable & fast implementation, please consider checking
out [cgbur/llama2.zig][2]!


## Development
- To run tests, it currently requires installing `PyTorch` to load checkpoint
    for checking whether weights are correctly mapped.
